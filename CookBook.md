## Original Data

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

## Features

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

*tBodyAcc-XYZ
*tGravityAcc-XYZ
*tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
*tBodyGyro-XYZ
*tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
*tBodyAccMag
*tGravityAccMag
*tBodyAccJerkMag
*tBodyGyroMag
*tBodyGyroJerkMag
*fBodyAcc-XYZ
*fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
*fBodyGyro-XYZ
*fBodyAccMag
*fBodyAccJerkMag
*fBodyGyroMag
*fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

*mean(): Mean value
*std(): Standard deviation
*mad(): Median absolute deviation 
*max(): Largest value in array
*min(): Smallest value in array
*sma(): Signal magnitude area
*energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
*iqr(): Interquartile range 
*entropy(): Signal entropy
*arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
*correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
*maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
*meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
*skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
*kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
*bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
*angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

*gravityMean
*tBodyAccMean
*tBodyAccJerkMean
*tBodyGyroMean
*tBodyGyroJerkMean


## Steps Taken to Tidy the Data

run_analysis.R has been created to do the following.

<ol>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. </li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. </li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set </li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. </li>
<li>From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. </li>
</ol>

## Imprementation Details of the Steps

* Install and load R packages dplyr and data.table if not already.
* Change work directory to where the data resides.
* Read in both train and test data, combine all columns and all rows into a single data frame.
* Extract the indices associated with columns with mean() or std() in the name, using features.txt file, then extract these columns from the data frame.
* Label activities using activity_labels.txt.
* To appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names, remove special characters in field description in features.txt to use as column name.
* Get the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, and save in another data frame.

## Resulting Tidy Data

The Resulting tidy Data is TidyData.txt, which has the average of each mean and std variable for each activity and each subject. If the pre-summarized data is needed, one can run the R code and output cleandata data frame to get the data.
